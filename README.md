# react-native-webpack-starter-kit
Get started with React Native and Webpack

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) 5.x or better
- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for development
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS development (optional)
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/) for Android development (optional)
- [Android Lollipop](https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/) or better for Android device testing (optional)

## Stack

- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for native app development
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6+ support
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module loader and bundler
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) for Windows-based development

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/7s4r/react-native-webpack-starter-kit.git && cd $_
npm i
```

## Running

Once dependencies are installed, run the starter kit with:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the React Packager and a [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server). The dev server will watch your JS files for changes and automatically lint and generate the `index.[platform].js` files expected by your React Native iOS or Android app.

### iOS

Open `ios/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode, build and run the project.

Unlike the app currently generated by `react-native init` this app removes the `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` key to prevent the app from logging an error in Xcode and leading to an App Store rejection. The key may be added back, if desired, but its value must be set to `true` to prevent unexpected rejection during the review process.

### Android

For android development use the following:

```sh
npm run android-setup-port # Note that this option is available on devices running android 5.0+ (API 21)
react-native run-android
```
